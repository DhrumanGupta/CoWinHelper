# Welcome to CoWinHelper!

These are 2 small projects I made  to help people get the vaccine! 
CoWinChecker is a console application which sends you messages on whatsapp if any vaccine is available.
CoWinDiscord is a more generalized try to help people get the vaccine (originally made for all of india, but the api blocked me for too many requests ;-;). Can be configured for your state of choice.

### Caution for developers:
This code *is* messy, I am sorry. Just wanted to get something running which can help out people. This isn't a long term project, as vaccne production is increasing.
